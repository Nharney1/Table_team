# Table_team Senior Design Repository for Team #14

## VISION - Visually Impaired Spatially Interactive Orientation Network 

<p align="justify">
Senior design is at the core of all engineering students' journey through university. When the team pondered what our project's focus should be, we knew one thing: we wanted to make something that could be the spark for future innovation to help others.

<p align="justify">
The Visually Impaired Spatial Interactive Orientation Network (VISION) is our effort toward this mission. VISION focuses on giving individuals with visual impairments a way to experience the world through playing billiards. With the use of audio arrays, a plethora of sensors,  computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI), and dedicated engineering students, VISION will be able to navigate a user from any given starting point to a calculated shooting location within a game of billiards! This project will open the door for future innovation within this field, and allows for the visually impaired to be able to enjoy billiards in the same way able-bodied individuals can today! VISION is a joint project and works with SCRATCH (team #17) to provide the full user experience!

<p align="justify">
The VISION team is eager to get to work on the design and implement a truly revolutionary system that will hopefully start a trend toward inclusivity for the visually impaired community! VISION's development is well underway, and we plan to have the project complete by the end of April 2023 for the Senior Design showcase at UCF!

My focus within the project is the computer vision system, networking with the various subsystem computers, and maintaining the central processing unit. The computer vision system is resposible for detecting which billiard balls are on the table and where the billiard balls are. The CV system relies on the open-source software  OPENCV to meet the projects needs. VISION communicates with various subsystems through wired and wireless communication. I designed and tested many different communication methods such as ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for allowing the subsystems to communicate within the university's strict network. I am also responsible for configuring and maintaining the central processing unit used by VISION. VISION uses an NVIDIA Jetson Nano as the main processor. I installed and modified drivers for Wi-FI/Bluetooth connectivity, set up and maintain the software enviornment, and assist with the processors integration into other subsystems.
