## VISION - Visually Impaired Spatially Interactive Orientation Network 

<p align="center">
Senior design is at the core of all engineering students' journey through university. When the team pondered what our project's focus should be, we knew one thing: we wanted to make something that could be the spark for future innovation to help others.

The Visually Impaired Spatial Interactive Orientation Network (VISION) is our effort toward this mission. VISION focuses on giving individuals with visual impairments a way to experience the world through playing billiards. With the use of audio arrays, a plethora of sensors,  computer vision, artificial intelligence, and dedicated engineering students, VISION will be able to navigate a user from any given starting point to a calculated shooting location within a game of billiards! This project will open the door for future innovation within this field, and allows for the visually impaired to be able to enjoy billiards in the same way able-bodied individuals can today! VISION is a joint project and works with SCRATCH (team #17) to provide the full user experience!
