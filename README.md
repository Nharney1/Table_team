VISION - Visually Impaired Spatially Interactive Orientation Network 

Senior design is at the core of all engineering students' journey through university. When my team and I pondered what our project's focus should be, we knew one thing: we wanted to make something that could be the spark for future innovation to help others.

The Visually Impaired Spatial Interactive Orientation Network (VISION) is our effort toward this mission. VISION focuses on giving individuals with difficulty seeing a proof of concept of how the world can continue to be opened up for them. Through audio arrays and a plethora of sensors and CV and billiards AI algorithms, our project will be able to navigate a user from any given starting point to the desired shooting location within a game of pool! This project will open the door for future innovation within this field, and may one day allow for the visually impaired to be able to enjoy billiards in the same way able-bodied individuals can today! My focus within the project is centered on the navigation system, audio interface, PCB design, and power distribution of the project. 
VISION's development is well underway, and we shoot to have the apparatus complete by the end of April 2023 for the Senior Design showcase at UCF!
